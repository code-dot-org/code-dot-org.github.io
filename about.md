Hi!

We're the developers at <a href="https://code.org">Code.org</a>, a non-profit dedicated to expanding access to computer science and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. We write the code that runs the websites, provides the tutorials and curriculum on <a href="https://studio.code.org">studio.code.org</a>, and keeps track of student and teacher progress. We do stuff in Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Javascript and React.

Our code is all <a href="https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org">open source</a>.

We are currently hiring Software Engineers and an Engineering Manager/Chief Architect. For more information check out our <a href="">jobs page</a>.
